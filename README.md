# Structural analysis and finite elements project

The project work served as
a practical illustration of the main concepts in the field of FE-modelling, in order to provide a deep
understanding of the theoretical concepts of the method by their practical implementation into
a FE code and to offer a first experience using a finite element software employed in the industry
(pre-processing, analysis, post-processing).



The main goal
was to quantify the axial and rotational stiffness of an engine mount via linear elastic finite element modelling. To get a sense of how finite element modelling works in practice,
a Matlab code program was completed and verified during the first sessions of the project. Therefore,
multiple concepts which were discussed in the theory classes were applied. Afterwards, a finite
element model of the engine mount was created using Salome-Meca. In this way, its axial and
rotational stiffnesses were determined for a simple and an advanced model, which results were
compared subsequently. Finally, using a simple plate model, a convergence study was done to
show equivalence between the Salome-Meca results and the analytical, closed form solution
